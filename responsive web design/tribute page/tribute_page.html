    <p>This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital.</p>
    <p> If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth.</p>
    <p> He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it.</p>
    <p> He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!</p>
